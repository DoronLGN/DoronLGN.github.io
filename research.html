    <p>
      My research broadly falls within the fields of algebraic topology, algebraic geometry, and homotopy theory. In particular, I am interested in understanding chromatic homotopy theory using tools from spectral arithmetic geometry, such as elliptic cohomology. I am currently working on describing ramified level structures on oriented elliptic curves, with the long-term goal of constructing an arithmetically global version of modular-equivariant topological modular forms and understanding the appearance of Langlands-type phenomena in chromatic homotopy theory.</p>
    <h2>What I'm currently thinking about</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Isogenies of oriented formal groups</li>
        <li>Spectral enhancement of the Drinfeld/Lubin-Tate isomorphism</li>
        <li>Moduli of oriented p-divisble groups</li>
      </ul>
  	<h2>Papers</h2>
  	  <ul>
  	  	<li><cite>Finite Manifolds and Minimal Finite Models of Closed Surfaces</cite> (<a href="FiniteManifolds.pdf">pdf</a>). Written for the University of Chicago Math REU, Fall 2018.</li>
  	  	<blockquote><b>Abstract:</b> We describe Stong minimality and absolute minimality of finite models of topological spaces, exhibit Stong minimal models of all closed surfaces, and derive several elementary lower bounds for the size of absolutely minimal models. We define the notion of a finite manifold and characterize finite surfaces, then use this characterization to show that a finite model of a closed surface is a finite surface if and only if it is induced by a regular CW structure on the surface. Finally, we use this result to deduce a better lower bound for the size of models which are finite surfaces and construct minimal finite surface models of orientable surfaces whose genera satisfy nice number-theoretic properties.</blockquote>

  	<h2>Talk Notes</h2>
      When writing notes for a talk, I sometimes end up with a text that can stand on its own as an exposition of the subject. In such cases, I upload those notes here in the hopes that someone will find them useful.

        <li><cite>Towards a Chromatic Langlands Program</cite> (<a href="TowardsChromaticLanglands.pdf">notes</a>). Given at the Graduate Student Homotopy Theory Seminar on March 10th, 2023.</li>
        <blockquote><b>Abstract:</b> Originally developed as a tool for computing the stable homotopy groups of spheres in topology, chromatic homotopy theory has proven to be highly interdisciplinary, possessing seemingly fundamental connections to number theory and the mathematics of high-energy physics. On the arithmetic side, it can be interpreted as a Brave New class field theory, with geometric models like tmf acting as a spectral version of arithmetic geometry. On the physical side, these complex-oriented cohomology theories act as receivers of “index maps” central to both concrete computations and geometry in quantum field theory. In this talk, I will propose a chromatic Langlands program that unifies notions of ramification, globalization, and equivariance appearing in these three fields. The approach taken involves modular and global equivariance for topological automorphic forms, cyclotomic trace as a description of geometric and algebraic ramification, and chromatic redshift; and, as suggested by the name, should be thought of as a spectral version of the Langlands program. Broadly speaking, the program aims to give a unified description of transchromatic geometry, and is expected to produce new computational tools in stable homotopy theory. Applications outside of topology include a rigorous interpretation of Witten’s equivariant index theory and arithmetic geometry over the field with one element.</blockquote>
        <li><cite>Elliptic Cohomology and Conformal Field Theories</cite> (<a href="EllipticAndCFT.pdf">notes</a>). Originally given on May 19th, 2022 as part of an advanced topics class on TQFT taught by Gabriele La Nave. Given in a revised form as a two-part talk at the Graduate Student Geometry and Topology Seminar on September 16th and 23rd, 2022.</li>
        <blockquote><b>Abstract:</b> One of the main goals of contemporary quantum field theory research is to compute and understand the path integrals associated to conformal field theories. In the 1980s, Witten and some others realized that these values could be interpreted as numerical invariants called <i>elliptic genera</i>, cohomological objects which contain deep information about geometric structures on manifolds. In this talk, I will describe the theory of elliptic genera and how the surprising relationships they encode can shed light on the underlying phenomena of conformal field theory.</blockquote>
        <li><cite>An Informal Introduction to Formal Groups</cite> (<a href="InformalIntroToFormalGroups.pdf">notes</a>). Given at the Graduate Student Commutative Algebra and Algebraic Geometry Seminar on April 12th, 2022.</li>
        <blockquote><b>Abstract:</b> Infinitesimal objects in algebraic geometry have a rich structure, but they are difficult to study due to the failure of classical Lie theory in the algebraic context, especially in characteristic p. This failure can be attributed to the fact that Lie algebras only capture first-order infinitesimal behavior, a limitation which vanishes when we shift our focus to a new kind of infinitesimal object: formal groups. In this talk, I will describe the basic theory and examples of formal groups, as well as how they give rise to a surprising and deep connection between algebraic geometry and algebraic topology: chromatic homotopy theory.</blockquote>

In this talk, I will describe the theory of these spaces and the nature of this correspondence, and discuss the resulting theory of finite models.</blockquote>
