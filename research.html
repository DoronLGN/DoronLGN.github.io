    <p>
      My research generally concerns algebraic topology, algebraic geometry, and homotopy theory. I am particularly interested in chromatic homotopy theory and its relationship to higher algebra and arithmetic geometry. I also have a broad interest in geometry done from an ∞-categorical perspective (e.g. spectral algebraic geometry), and a somewhat more narrow interest in quantum field theory (especially as it relates to chromatic homotopy).</p>
    <h2>What I'm currently thinking about</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Chromatic Langlands</li>
        <li>Arithmetically global modular-equivariant tmf</li>
        <li>Ramification in transchromatic geometry</li>
      </ul>
  	<h2>Papers</h2>
  	  <ul>
  	  	<li><cite>Finite Manifolds and Minimal Finite Models of Closed Surfaces</cite> (<a href="FiniteManifolds.pdf">pdf</a>). Written for the University of Chicago Math REU, Fall 2018.</li>
  	  	<blockquote><b>Abstract:</b> We describe Stong minimality and absolute minimality of finite models of topological spaces, exhibit Stong minimal models of all closed surfaces, and derive several elementary lower bounds for the size of absolutely minimal models. We define the notion of a finite manifold and characterize finite surfaces, then use this characterization to show that a finite model of a closed surface is a finite surface if and only if it is induced by a regular CW structure on the surface. Finally, we use this result to deduce a better lower bound for the size of models which are finite surfaces and construct minimal finite surface models of orientable surfaces whose genera satisfy nice number-theoretic properties.</blockquote>

  	<h2>Talk Notes</h2>
      When writing notes for a talk, I sometimes end up with a text that can stand on its own as an exposition of the subject. In such cases, I upload those notes here in the hopes that someone will find them useful.
  	  <ul>
        <li><cite>Elliptic Cohomology and Conformal Field Theories</cite> (<a href="EllipticAndCFT.pdf">notes</a>). Originally given on May 19th, 2022 as part of an advanced topics class on TQFT taught by Gabriele La Nave. Given in a revised form as a two-part talk at the Graduate Student Geometry and Topology Seminar on September 16th and 23rd, 2022.</li>
        <blockquote><b>Abstract:</b> One of the main goals of contemporary quantum field theory research is to compute and understand the path integrals associated to conformal field theories. In the 1980s, Witten and some others realized that these values could be interpreted as numerical invariants called <i>elliptic genera</i>, cohomological objects which contain deep information about geometric structures on manifolds. In this talk, I will describe the theory of elliptic genera and how the surprising relationships they encode can shed light on the underlying phenomena of conformal field theory.</blockquote>
        <li><cite>An Informal Introduction to Formal Groups</cite> (<a href="InformalIntroToFormalGroups.pdf">notes</a>). Given at the Graduate Student Commutative Algebra and Algebraic Geometry Seminar on April 12th, 2022.</li>
        <blockquote><b>Abstract:</b> Infinitesimal objects in algebraic geometry have a rich structure, but they are difficult to study due to the failure of classical Lie theory in the algebraic context, especially in characteristic p. This failure can be attributed to the fact that Lie algebras only capture first-order infinitesimal behavior, a limitation which vanishes when we shift our focus to a new kind of infinitesimal object: formal groups. In this talk, I will describe the basic theory and examples of formal groups, as well as how they give rise to a surprising and deep connection between algebraic geometry and algebraic topology: chromatic homotopy theory.</blockquote>
  	  	<li><cite>Simplicial Localizations and How to Find Them</cite> (<a href="Simplicial Localizations and How to Find Them.pdf">notes</a>). Given at the Graduate Student Homotopy Theory Seminar on October 8th, 2021.</li>
  	  	<blockquote><b>Abstract:</b> Abstractly defining ∞-categorical localization is easy, but explicitly constructing it is hard. Following a series of papers by Dwyer and Kan, I will describe the construction known as the hammock localization and use it to obtain a clearer picture of some important ∞-categories.</blockquote>
  	  	<li><cite>Finite Spaces and Finite Models</cite> (<a href="Finite Spaces and Finite Models.pdf">notes</a>). Given at the Graduate Student Homotopy Theory Seminar on September 14th, 2020.</li>
  	  	<blockquote><b>Abstract:</b> When we try to model simplicial complexes using posets, finite spaces arise as a natural bridge between these two categories. In this talk, I will describe the theory of these spaces and the nature of this correspondence, and discuss the resulting theory of finite models.</blockquote>
