      My research generally concerns algebraic topology and homotopy theory. I am particularly interested in higher algebra, spectral algebraic geometry, and their connections to topology. One of modern homotopy theory's most fascinating insights is that topology (the study of spaces) and algebra (the study of categories and their internal logics) can both be seen as special cases of the theory of ∞-categories; this is famously expressed via Grothendieck's <i>homotopy hypothesis</i>, which states that spaces are the same as ∞-groupoids. In my research, I aim to explore this connection further, examining the still-developing landscape of "Brave New Algebra".</p>
  	<h2>Papers</h2>
  	  <ul>
  	  	<li><cite>Finite Manifolds and Minimal Finite Models of Closed Surfaces</cite> (<a href="FiniteManifolds.pdf">pdf</a>). Written for the University of Chicago Math REU, Fall 2018.</li>
  	  	<blockquote><b>Abstract:</b> We describe Stong minimality and absolute minimality of finite models of topological spaces, exhibit Stong minimal models of all closed surfaces, and derive several elementary lower bounds for the size of absolutely minimal models. We define the notion of a finite manifold and characterize finite surfaces, then use this characterization to show that a finite model of a closed surface is a finite surface if and only if it is induced by a regular CW structure on the surface. Finally, we use this result to deduce a better lower bound for the size of models which are finite surfaces and construct minimal finite surface models of orientable surfaces whose genera satisfy nice number-theoretic properties.</blockquote>

  	<h2>Talks</h2>
  	  <ul>
  	  	<li><cite>Simplicial Localizations and How to Find Them</cite> <a href="Simplicial Localizations and How to Find Them.pdf">(notes)</a>. Given at the Graduate Student Homotopy Theory Seminar on October 8th, 2021.</li>
  	  	<blockquote><b>Abstract:</b> Abstractly defining ∞-categorical localization is easy, but explicitly constructing it is hard. Following a series of papers by Dwyer and Kan, I will describe the construction known as the hammock localization and use it to obtain a clearer picture of some important ∞-categories.</blockquote>
  	  	<li><cite>Finite Spaces and Finite Models</cite> <a href="Finite Spaces and Finite Models.pdf">(notes)</a>. Given at the Graduate Student Homotopy Theory Seminar on September 14th, 2020.</li>
  	  	<blockquote><b>Abstract:</b> When we try to model simplicial complexes using posets, finite spaces arise as a natural bridge between these two categories. In this talk, I will describe the theory of these spaces and the nature of this correspondence, and discuss the resulting theory of finite models.</blockquote>
