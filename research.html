    <p>
      My research broadly falls within the fields of algebraic topology, algebraic geometry, and homotopy theory. In particular, I am interested in understanding chromatic homotopy theory using tools from spectral arithmetic geometry, such as elliptic cohomology. I am currently working on describing ramified level structures on oriented elliptic curves, with the long-term goal of constructing an arithmetically global version of modular-equivariant topological modular forms and understanding the appearance of Langlands-type phenomena in chromatic homotopy theory.</p>
    <h2>What I'm currently thinking about</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Isogenies of oriented formal groups</li>
        <li>Strictness in chromatic homotopy theory</li>
      </ul>
  	<h2>Papers</h2>
  	  <ul>
        <li><cite>Complex Orientations are Partial Strictifications of the Unit</cite> (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01663">arXiv</a>).</li>
  	  	<li><cite>Finite Manifolds and Minimal Finite Models of Closed Surfaces</cite> (<a href="Papers\FiniteManifolds.pdf">pdf</a>). Written for the University of Chicago Math REU, Fall 2018.</li>
  	  </ul>
  	<h2>Selected Talk Notes</h2>
      When writing notes for a talk, I sometimes end up with a text that can stand on its own as an exposition of the subject. In such cases, I upload those notes here in the hopes that someone will find them useful.
