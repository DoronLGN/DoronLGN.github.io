    <p>
      My research broadly falls within the fields of algebraic topology, algebraic geometry, and homotopy theory. In particular, I am interested in understanding chromatic homotopy theory using tools from spectral arithmetic geometry, such as elliptic cohomology. My current research concerns isogenies of oriented elliptic curves—to be precise, the moduli stack of these isogenies and the closely related moduli stacks of elliptic curves with level structure. I intend to use these stacks to develop an arithmetically global theory of modular-equivariant elliptic cohomology, and with it a theory of topological modular Galois representations.</p>

  	<h2>Selected Talk Notes</h2>
      When writing notes for a talk, I sometimes end up with a text that can stand on its own as an exposition of the subject. In such cases, I upload those notes here in the hopes that someone will find them useful.
